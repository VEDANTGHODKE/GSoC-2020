#Code: WhatsApp Blaster

This repository contains a basic idea of my way to integrate a WhatsApp with core ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) softwares for data abstraction and mass blasting

The project requires a few pre-requisites to be pre-installed in your PC's. They are as follows:

1. Selenium Webdriver for Chrome or Firefox
2. Python Version 3 or above.
3. pip package.
4. Mentioned pip packages in the code.
5. A suitable Python IDE or Python environment for running this code.


Make sure to update the 'Mob_Nos_2.xlsx' file with the company names and mobile numbers.
Check the status of blasting regularly with the 'STATUS.xlsx' file.

HAPPY CODING!
